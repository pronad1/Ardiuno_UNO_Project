ESP8266 Pin, Connect to Arduino Pin
VCC / 3V3,3.3V
GND, GND
CH_PD (EN),3.3V
RX, Pin 3
TX, Pin 2
If ESP take long time to reset then need to hard coding manually that is :-
'Connect RST to VCC just for one time'


Pump Power Wiring:

Pump VCC (+) -> Connect to Relay COM (Common).

Relay NO (Normally Open) -> Connect to the External Battery's Positive (+) terminal.

Pump GND (-) -> Connect to External Battery Negative (-).
