###To set up a standalone ATmega328 on a breadboard using an Arduino Uno for programming, you need a minimal circuit and specific connections for power, timing, and programming. 
Required Components
- ATmega328 (DIP package, preferably pre-bootloaded)
- Breadboard
- Arduino Uno board
- 16 MHz Crystal oscillator
- Two 22 pF ceramic capacitors
- One 10 kΩ resistor
- Jumper wires
- (Optional) 0.1 uF capacitor between VCC and GND for decoupling
- (Optional) Pushbutton for easier resetting
